* "Odds of success" refers to the fraction of the probability of an event ocurring over the probability of the event not occurring. For example, if the probability of an event occurring is 0.7, then the odds of success is equal to `0.7 / (1 - 0.7) = 0.7 / 0.3 = 7/3`. Low probability of of occuring and success rate are correlated, meaning that a low probability of an event occuring results also in low odds of success.
